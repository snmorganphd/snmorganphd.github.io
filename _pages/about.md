I am an agricultural and applied economist and currently work as a Research Agricultural Economist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. My research program focuses on international trade and investment flows, agricultural productivity, sustainable intensification, and agricultural technology adoption. 

Prior to coming to ERS, I was faculty in the Food and Resource Economics Department at the University of Florida. I previously served as a Fulbright Scholar, researching agricultural development and community participation in Zambia and as an intern with USDA ERS, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), and the U.S. Agency for International Development.

I completed a Ph.D. in Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics at Michigan State University. I also earned a masters degree in Political Science from Duke University, and undergraduate degree in Food and Resource Economics at the University of Florida.
